# MyWebControllerSample

Hello, this is my WebAPI project.

In it, I use controllers, as well as HTTP Get methods.

To work with entities, I created their models. 

Also, each model has its own service that implements the corresponding interface.

**Frameworks and libraries used:**
+ Platform - ` ASP.Net Core 2.2 `
+ Documentation - `Swagger`
+ Programming language - `C#`
+ Data storage - `SQL Server 2017 DE`
+ Data access -` Entity Framework Core`
+ Dependency injection -` Native ASP.NET Core IOC container`
+ Object mapping - `AutoMapper`
+ Logging - `SeriLog`
+ Unit testing - `xUnit, Moq, FluentAssertions`
